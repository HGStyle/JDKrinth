# JDKrinth
## A database editor app to force Modrinth to use a specific Java version

Download inside releases: https://github.com/HGStyle/JDKrinth/releases

## Why?

I made this since Modrinth does not let you modify every Java installation it uses. 
Currently, it only let you edit the path for Java 8, Java 16 and Java 21, but most 
importantly not Java 17. This program makes you able to add your own Java 
installation and delete the other ones using the same major Java version to force 
Modrinth to use your Java version, and not theirs.
